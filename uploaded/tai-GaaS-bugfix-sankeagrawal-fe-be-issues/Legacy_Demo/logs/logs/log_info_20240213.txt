Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.\n\n4. Dip each chicken breast first in the flour, then in the beaten egg, and finally in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to help the coating adhere.\n\n5.

In the same skillet, add the crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n8. Pour the tomato sauce over the chicken breasts, ensuring they are evenly coated.\n\n9. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the chicken breasts, covering them completely.\n\n10.
