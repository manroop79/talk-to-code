Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n\n2. Gather your ingredients:\n   - 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n   - Salt and pepper, to taste\n   - 1 cup all-purpose flour\n   - 2 large eggs, beaten\n   - 2 cups breadcrumbs (plain or Italian-seasoned)\n   - 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n   - 1/4 cup olive oil\n   - 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes\n   - 1 tablespoon dried basil\n   - 1 tablespoon dried oregano\n   - 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n   - 1/2 teaspoon sugar\n   - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)\n   - 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced\n   - Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)\n\n3. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.\n\n4. Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with a mixture of breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese.\n\n5. Dredge each chicken breast in flour, then dip it in the beaten egg, and finally coat it with the breadcrumb mixture. Press the breadcrumbs gently onto the chicken to ensure they stick.\n\n6. In a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Cook the chicken breasts until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.\n\n7. In a separate bowl, combine the crushed tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, garlic powder, sugar, and red pepper flakes (if using). Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts in the skillet.\n\n8. Cover the skillet with a lid or aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is bubbling.\n\n9. Remove the skillet from the oven and carefully lift the chicken breasts onto a serving platter.\n\n10. Top each chicken breast with sliced mozzarella cheese.\n\n11. Return the skillet to the oven and broil for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and slightly browned.\n\n12. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired, and serve with your favorite pasta or side dish.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade chicken parmesan!"}
